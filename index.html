    <h1>The father film premiere July 16, 2021</h1> 
    <h3> Antony is 80, mischievous, living defiantly alone and rejecting the carers that his daughter, Anne, encouragingly introduces.
     Yet help is also becoming a necessity for Anne; she can’t make daily visits anymore and Anthony's grip on reality is unravelling. 
    As we experience the ebb and flow of his memory, how much of his own identity and past can Anthony cling to?</h3>
